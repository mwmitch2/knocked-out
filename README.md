Project name 'knocked-out'

## Description

Sport, card, and video game enthusiasts everywhere have a need for fast, easy to use tournament software to setup and 
automatically display and track brackets for their next big competition.

All parts of the tournament process are now streamlined, from participant sign-up to organizer formatting, allowing more
time to enjoy the event. Depending on your particular tournament needs we offer single elimination, double elimination, 
and round robin solutions. Seeding for the brackets can be set by the tournament organizer or randomly generated. The
indepth statistic tracking is viewable at all levels with colored graphics and detailed reports. Tournament details are
stored in a database so organizers can access data from previous tournament.

Game on!!!
